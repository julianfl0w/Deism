## Cosmology


### Origins

<sup>0</sup> Fourteen billion years ago, God created our universe. <sup>1</sup> It started from nothing, then expanded rapidly. <sup>2</sup> And the earth was without form. <sup>3</sup> 5 billion years ago, the earth coalesced, in orbit around the sun. <sup>4</sup> Shortly thereafter, organized life emerged from the chaos. <sup>5</sup> Many generations passed. <sup>6</sup> 300 thousand years ago, humankind originated in Africa. <sup>7</sup> And we expanded throughout the earth. <sup>8</sup> At that time, chaos governed our steps. <sup>9</sup> But we were united under a common God. <sup>10</sup> Now we seek to know God. 


### Topology

### Regions

<sup>0</sup> The cosmos are governed by two forces: chaos and order. <sup>1</sup> Both are vital to our development. <sup>2</sup> Generally, Deism represents order. <sup>3</sup> Whoever is with us will gather, whoever is not will scatter.

## Introduction

<sup>0</sup> There is one God, who has spoken to no one<br><br><sup>1</sup> The Book of Julian is the first book of the Third Testament. <sup>2</sup> It presents a philosophical framework that combines spiritual and scientific schools of thought. <sup>3</sup> It draws primarily upon Christian theology and contemporary cosmology. <sup>4</sup> Design principles of Book of Julian include:
- Clarity
  - Hierarchical Organization
  - Images
  - Diagrams
  - Metaphors
  - Examples
- Simplicity
- Brevity
- Accuracy
- Practical Value


<sup>5</sup> When these principles are in conflict, simple expressions are preferred. <sup>6</sup> The writings herein are so simple that a wise person can understand it by lunchtime, and a fool by sundown. <sup>7</sup> The Book of Julian standardizes the Deist religion. <sup>8</sup> It shall be referred to as Standard Doctrine, against which the chaotic doctrines of the world can be compared. <sup>9</sup> Standard Doctrine is compatible with the following theories
- Big Bang theory
- Theory of Evolution
- Out-of-Africa Theory
- Creationism





## Lineage

<sup>0</sup> Introduction. 
### Material


#### Evolutionary

<sup>0</sup> The Tree of Life. <sup>1</sup> This is our evolutionary lineage:<sup>2</sup> Evolutionary Lineage
- The Fundamental Particles, which is the soil
- LUCA, which is the seed
- Eukarya, the trunk
- Animalia, the largest branches
- Humankind, the leaves
- The Son of Man, who will usher in the new age





#### Migratory

<sup>0</sup> This is our migratory history, which is the basis of our racial theory
- 300,000 years ago, humankind originated in Africa
- 150,000 years ago, we expanded into Eurasia
- 50,000 years ago, we expanded into Australia
- 15,000 years ago, we expanded into America



Simplified migratory chart

![Simplified migratory chart](/graphs/Simplified_migratory_chart.png?raw=true)

<sup>1</sup> Based upon the first migration, there are three races: African, Asian, and European. 




### Spiritual


#### Personal

<sup>0</sup> The Tree of Spirit. <sup>1</sup> This is our personal spiritual lineage:
- Abraham, who established the first covenant
- David, who unified the people
- Jesus, who established the second covenant
- Paul, who established the church
- Constantine, who unified the people
- Thomas Aquinas, who unified the doctrine
- Martin Luther, who refined the doctrine
- Julian, who established the third covenant





#### Ideological

<sup>0</sup> In the beginning, there was no religion, for there was no language. <sup>1</sup> Then there were many gods, for there were no standards. <sup>2</sup> This was the beginning of the Spiritual Age. <sup>3</sup> Then there was one God, and his name was Jehovah. <sup>4</sup> Then there were three Gods in one, the holy trinity. <sup>5</sup> Now there is one God, outside of this universe. <sup>6</sup> This is the path by which we have entered the Metaphysical Age. <sup>7</sup> In the Beatific Vision, when we see the face of God, we will enter the Positive Age. 
Our Ideological Spiritual Lineage is an evolutionary heritage, delineated by major reformational events

<sup>2</sup> Theology. 
## Wisdom


### Wisdom

<sup>0</sup> How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!<sup>[a](PR 16:16)</sup> . 

<sup>1</sup> Where there is strife, there is pride, but wisdom is found in those who take advice<sup>[b](PR 13:10)</sup> . 

<sup>2</sup> Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent<sup>[c](PR 17:28)</sup> . 

<sup>3</sup> For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their name is forgotten<sup>[d](EC 9:5)</sup> . 

<sup>4</sup> Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom<sup>[e](EC 9:10)</sup> . 

<sup>5</sup> As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another<sup>[f](PR 27:17)</sup> . 

<sup>6</sup> A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.<sup>[g](PR 15:1)</sup> . 

<sup>7</sup> One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother<sup>[h](PR 18:24)</sup> . 

<sup>8</sup> Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm<sup>[i](PR 13:20)</sup> . 

<sup>9</sup> A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed<sup>[j](PR 11:25)</sup> .
