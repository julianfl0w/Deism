#### Shoutouts
<sup>0</sup> We remember the Christians, who established peaceful empires and banished slavery. <sup>1</sup> Blessed are those who forsake the darkness and choose to walk in the light. <sup>2</sup> To the followers of Allah, Brahma, Yahweh, you have been superseeded. Those who continue in this path will be disadvantaged in this life, and discriminated against in the ascention. We'll try to be respectful, but also your ways are backwards and your ideas are stupid. You have failed to maintain the disciplines of science so now you will be discrimintated against. Destructin will follow your family to the seventh generation. Annhialation will be suspended. You will be in anti-purgatory indefinately. Bye.
