# Prophesy

## Eternal Life

### Universal Annhialation

In the absense of compelling evidence, we believe in Universal Annhialation. That is, the absense of life after death. This is motivation for research into eternal life. There are currently two major strains of research:
- Perpetual animation of the body
- Transferral of one's spirit






## Eschatology

When we see the face of God, this is the Beatific Vision. 

## The Fourth Temple

The Third Temple will be destroyed, and a fourth built in its place. The Fourth Temple will be a pyramid of clear gold. It will be built in three days. 



# Introduction

There is one God, who has spoken to no one. The Book of Julian is the first book of the Third Testament. It presents a philosophical framework that combines spiritual and scientific schools of thought. It draws primarily upon Christian theology and contemporary cosmology. ## Design principles of Book of Julian include:

### Clarity

Hierarchical Organization. Images. Diagrams. Metaphors. Examples. 

Brevity. Accuracy. 

When these principles are in conflict, simple expressions are preferred. The writings herein are so simple that a wise man can understand it by lunchtime, and a fool by sundown. 

Missiology. # Lineage
