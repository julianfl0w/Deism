Our faith is always burning
Our truth is never ending
Now it's agreed that we
Should sing what we believe

We affirm
Out of Africa Theory
Big bang cosmology
Macroevolution


We believe

We support

We suspect
Annhialationalism

Weeee deny (Yes, Lord!)
Special Revelation
The Resurection of the body
The Holy Trinity
The Immaculate Conception
The Blessed Rosary
The Communion of the Saints
Christs descent into hell
The Advocate of Jesus

They are incompatible with our doctrine

We reject 
Neopeganism
The Authority of scripture

We decline

We dispute

We lay claim
Spiritual decendence from Abraham
The Dome of the Rock
Continuation of the line of David

No one needs to write another hymn
I have closed that field
